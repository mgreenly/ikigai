{"iteration":2,"timestamp":"2026-01-11T12:14:28-06:00","progress":"Deleted 9 source files and 12 test files for internal tool implementation. Modified src/tool.h to keep only ik_tool_call_t type and ik_tool_call_create, ik_tool_arg_get_string, ik_tool_arg_get_int functions. Created src/tool_call.c with ik_tool_call_create implementation. Updated src/providers/request_tools.c to remove tool definitions and skip tool population. Updated src/repl_tool.c to return stub \"Tool system not yet implemented\" response. Updated Makefile to remove deleted files and add tool_call.c. Fixed 4 test files to expect stub behavior instead of real tool execution. Running final verification now."}
