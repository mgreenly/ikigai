User provided a file path reference but the file content was not included in the message. I need the user to clarify what assistance they need. The file path `/tmp/ralph2-prompt20260111-1586653-5yptrg.md` appears to be a temporary file, but I cannot access files outside the working directory `/home/ai4mgreenly/projects/claude-1/` without the user providing the content or a relative path within the project.
