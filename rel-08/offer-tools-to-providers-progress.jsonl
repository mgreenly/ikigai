{"iteration":2,"timestamp":"2026-01-13T14:35:31-06:00","progress":"Updated ik_request_build_from_conversation signature to accept ik_tool_registry_t *registry parameter. Modified src/providers/request.h to include tool_registry.h and added registry parameter. Updated src/providers/request_tools.c to iterate registry entries and extract tool schema data (name, description, parameters) from yyjson, serializing parameters to JSON string for ik_request_add_tool. Updated all call sites in src/repl_actions_llm.c, src/repl_tool_completion.c, and src/commands_fork.c to pass agent->shared->tool_registry. Updated wrapper_internal.h and wrapper_internal.c to match new signature. Updated all test mocks across 9 test files to add the registry parameter (passing NULL in tests, (void)registry in mocks). Compilation now passes. Next: run remaining quality checks (filesize, check, complexity, sanitize, tsan, valgrind, helgrind, coverage)."}
