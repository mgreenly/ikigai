Goal

Create a file `tests/pipeline-test-spot.md` with the following content:

```
# Pipeline Test (Spot-Check)

This file was created by the pipeline orchestrator test.
```

Iteration 1

Dirty working copy detected and committed, use `jj diff -r tslwyyqktylz` to see the changes.

Iteration 2

? system (+3s / 3s)

? system (+0s / 3s)

I'll check the current state of the target file and create it if needed. (+7s / 11s) [8.4%]

The file doesn't exist yet. I'll create it with the required content. (+2s / 14s) [8.6%]

I found the issue - the `.ralphs/` directory is in the gitignore, so jj doesn't track it. However, the file exists on disk with the correct content. Let me verify the acceptance criteria are met: (+8s / 1m 21s) [10.0%]
