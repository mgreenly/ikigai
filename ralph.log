RALPH v0.4.0

Braindead agentic loop. Just keep trying until it works.

Params

Model: sonnet | Reasoning: med | Max Duration: unlimited

Goal

Create a file `pipeline-test-auto.md` in the project root with the following content:

```
# Pipeline Test (Auto-Merge)

This file was created by the pipeline orchestrator test.
```

Iteration 1

Dirty working copy detected and committed, use `jj diff -r lzktoymmuvup` to see the changes.

Iteration 2

? system (+3s / 3s)

? system (+0s / 3s)

? system (+0s / 3s)

I need to check the current state of the working copy and whether the target file already exists. (+5s / 9s) [8.4%]

→ Bash command="jj status", description="Check current working copy status" (+0s / 9s)

→ Glob pattern=pipeline-test-auto.md (+0s / 10s)

← Bash stdout="Working copy changes: M ralph.log Working cop...", stderr=, interrupted=false, isImage=false (+1s / 11s)

← Glob filenames=[], durationMs=191, numFiles=0, truncated=false (+0s / 11s)

The file doesn't exist yet. I'll create it with the required content. (+2s / 14s) [8.6%]

→ Write file_path=/home/ai4mgreenly/projects/ikigai-2/.ralphs/2..., content="# Pipeline Test (Auto-Merge) This file was cr..." (+2s / 16s)

← Write type=create, filePath=/home/ai4mgreenly/projects/ikigai-2/.ralphs/2..., content="# Pipeline Test (Auto-Merge) This file was cr...", structuredPatch=[], originalFile= (+0s / 17s)

→ Read file_path=/home/ai4mgreenly/projects/ikigai-2/.ralphs/2... (+4s / 21s)

← Read type=text, file={"filePath":"/home/ai4mgreenly/projects/ikiga... (+0s / 21s)

→ Bash command="jj status", description="Verify working copy status after file creation" (+0s / 21s)

← Bash stdout="Working copy changes: A pipeline-test-auto.md...", stderr=, interrupted=false, isImage=false (+0s / 22s)

Perfect! All acceptance criteria are met:

1. ✓ File `pipeline-test-auto.md` exists in the project root
2. ✓ File contains the heading "Pipeline Test (Auto-Merge)"
3. ✓ No other files were modified (ralph.log was already modified before this iteration) (+7s / 29s) [9.0%]

→ StructuredOutput summary=DONE (+0s / 30s)

← StructuredOutput  (+0s / 30s)


✓ DONE
