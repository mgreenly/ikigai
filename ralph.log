I'll start by reading the pipeline skill file to understand its current structure, then make the required updates. (+4s / 7s) [8.4%]

→ Read file_path=/home/ai4mgreenly/projects/ikigai-4/.claude/l... (+1s / 8s)

← Read  (+0s / 8s)

Let me search for the pipeline skill file: (+2s / 11s) [8.6%]

→ Glob pattern=**/*pipeline*SKILL.md (+0s / 11s)

← Glob filenames=[], durationMs=183, numFiles=0, truncated=false (+0s / 11s)

→ Bash command="ls -la .claude/library/", description="List contents of .claude/library directory" (+3s / 15s)

← Bash stdout="total 188 drwxrwsr-x 47 ai4mgreenly ai4mgreen...", stderr=, interrupted=false, isImage=false (+0s / 16s)

→ Grep pattern=goal-create, output_mode=files_with_matches (+6s / 22s)

← Grep mode=files_with_matches, filenames=["goal.md","project/pipeline.md",".claude/har..., numFiles=3 (+0s / 23s)

→ Read file_path=/home/ai4mgreenly/projects/ikigai-4/.claude/l... (+0s / 23s)

← Read type=text, file={"filePath":"/home/ai4mgreenly/projects/ikiga... (+0s / 28s)

Now I understand the structure. I need to create a new pipeline skill file based on the project/pipeline.md documentation. Let me create the directory and the SKILL.md file with the required updates. (+8s / 36s) [13.7%]

→ Bash command="mkdir -p .claude/library/pipeline", description="Create pipeline skill directory" (+0s / 37s)

← Bash stdout=, stderr=, interrupted=false, isImage=false (+0s / 37s)

→ Write file_path=/home/ai4mgreenly/projects/ikigai-4/.claude/l..., content="--- name: pipeline description: Claude Pipeli..." (+25s / 1m 3s)

← Write type=create, filePath=/home/ai4mgreenly/projects/ikigai-4/.claude/l..., content="--- name: pipeline description: Claude Pipeli...", structuredPatch=[], originalFile= (+0s / 1m 4s)
