I need to delete `pipeline-test-auto.md` from the project root. Let me first check if the file exists and understand the directory structure. (+11s / 14s) [8.4%]

← Bash stdout="Working copy changes: D pipeline-test-auto.md...", stderr=, interrupted=false, isImage=false (+1s / 35s)

Perfect! The file `pipeline-test-auto.md` has been successfully deleted. Verification shows:

- File no longer exists (ls returns "No such file or directory")
- `jj status` shows only `D pipeline-test-auto.md` as the deletion
- `ralph.log` appears modified but was already modified before this iteration (visible in initial git status)

The acceptance criteria are met: the file is deleted and no other files were modified by this action. (+9s / 44s) [9.5%]
