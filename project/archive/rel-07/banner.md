# MVP or Bust! (Day 6 of 14)

I'm using my holiday vacation to crunch and see just how close to the MVP we
can get. Claude finally finished the 200+ tasks that was rel-07. It fell off
the rails twice and needed some guidance. When it finished there were a few
small functionality gaps that we cleaned up yesterday.  We ran the first pass
on the quality check improvements yesterday to bring up the code coverage.
From here on out it's just adding polish until we tag the relese on Sunday.
