Load developer persona and task skills, then continue fixing gaps in task files.

CONTEXT:
- Project: ikigai (Linux coding agent, C codebase)
- Working on: 8 task files in scratch/tasks/ for legacy OpenAI cleanup migration
- Status: 7/13 critical gap fixes completed (70% done)
- Remaining: 6 fixes needed to make tasks ready for unattended execution

WHAT WAS COMPLETED:
✅ Added complete struct definitions to tasks 1, 5
✅ Specified JSON schemas (data_json, OpenAI API) to tasks 1, 7
✅ Added algorithms (yyjson parsing, deep copy, geometric growth) to tasks 1, 5
✅ Resolved system message contradiction across tasks 1, 4, 6

WHAT'S LEFT TO DO (in priority order):
1. HIGH: Add standardized error handling policy to all 8 tasks
2. HIGH: Remove all line number references, replace with code patterns
3. MED: Add fallback search patterns to task 2
4. MED: Add test pattern reference to task 8
5. MED: Split task 7 into 7a (deletion) and 7b (refactoring)
6. Verification: Run checklist to confirm all tasks ready

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Read scratch/resume-gap-fixing.md for complete details
2. Use TodoWrite to track progress through remaining 6 fixes
3. Start with HIGH priority tasks (error handling, line numbers)
4. Run verification commands before declaring complete

ESTIMATED TIME: 2-3 hours
