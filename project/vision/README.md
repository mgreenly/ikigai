# Ikigai Vision

**Amplification through Agents, Compounding over Time**

---

## Overview

Ikigai is a platform for building intelligent agent systems that amplify what a small team can do. Instead of building software directly, you build a system of agents that learns your codebase, infrastructure, and workflows. These agents become durable capabilities that improve over time.

This folder contains the authoritative vision documents for the project.

## Documents

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [What is Ikigai](what-is-ikigai.md) | The core vision: what we're building and why |
| [Architecture](architecture.md) | High-level system design and key concepts |
| [Autonomous Agents](autonomous-agents.md) | How agents work, communicate, and coordinate |
| [Infrastructure](infrastructure.md) | The runtime layer: services, databases, and deployment |

## Reading Order

1. **Start with [What is Ikigai](what-is-ikigai.md)** - Understand the problem we're solving and the approach
2. **Then [Architecture](architecture.md)** - See how the pieces fit together
3. **Then [Autonomous Agents](autonomous-agents.md)** - Understand the agent model
4. **Finally [Infrastructure](infrastructure.md)** - Learn how it all runs

## Key Concepts

**Meta-Project**: You don't build your product directly. You build a control plane of agents that builds and operates your product.

**Dual Building**: Develop your target product and its agent system simultaneously. As the product grows, so does the capability to build and manage it.

**Compounding Leverage**: Early investment in teaching agents pays off over time. What starts as 2x becomes 5x, then 10x.

**Control Plane**: The collection of agents that understand and manage your target system. It runs locally during development, on a server in production.
