# dropbox — build loop (gather → build → verify)

This directory holds the **three-prompt build loop** an unattended harness
(`ralph`) re-invokes with a **fresh context** every turn to build the dropbox
service one phase at a time, plus the operator wrapper that launches it. This
README describes the loop **as installed here** — it lives beside the prompts so
it can never drift from them. It carries only *loop mechanics*; the spec shapes
(product / design / plan) live under `../design`, `../plan`, `../product` and are
not restated here.

## Running it

From the **service root** (`dropbox/`, ralph's working directory):

```
./project/loops/run
```

which is exactly:

```sh
exec ralph project/loops/gather.md project/loops/build.md project/loops/verify.md
```

`ralph` cycles the three prompts in order and wraps `verify → gather`. Each prompt
is read in a **fresh, isolated context**; all cross-turn state lives in the
workspace (`project/plan/STATUS.md` markers, the ephemeral `brief.md`). Toolchain
commands run directly from the service root (`go build ./...`, not `cd dropbox &&
…`).

## The status contract

Each turn ends with a `{status, message}` the harness supplies out of band
(`ralph` injects the schema per backend — codex `--output-schema`, claude
`--json-schema`) and reads back itself; the prompts never hard-code a transport.
`ralph` reads only the **terminal** (last) message of a turn and advances on it:

| status | meaning |
|---|---|
| `CONTINUE` | **non-terminal** — a progress message streamed *before* the turn's final message (a streaming backend like codex tags every mid-turn message). Never advances the loop. |
| `NEXT` | **terminal** — this turn is done; advance to the next prompt (wrapping `verify → gather`). |
| `DONE` | **terminal** — the whole job is complete; the loop stops. **Only `gather` ever reports this**, and only when no `⬜` phase remains. |

`build` and `verify` **always** report `NEXT` — never `DONE`. Finishing a phase
completely (green suite, all gaps closed) is still `NEXT`; ending the run belongs
to `gather` alone.

## Per-step reads / writes / commits / flips

| step | reads | writes | commits | flips marker |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **gather** | `STATUS.md`, one `phase-NN.md`, `INDEX.md`, the realized `DNN.md`, (product for intent) | `brief.md` **contract region** — only for a phase with no in-flight brief | no | no |
| **build** | `brief.md` (contract **+** feedback) only | production code + co-located id-tagged tests | yes (the code increment) | no |
| **verify** | `brief.md` (contract + its own feedback), the suite | `STATUS.md` flip **or** `brief.md` feedback region | the one-line `⬜→✅` flip (pass only) | **yes** (pass only) |

Only `gather` reads the big docs; only `verify` flips a marker or deletes the
brief.

## The brief lifecycle

`project/loops/brief.md` is the ephemeral, **git-ignored**, single-phase seam that
keeps `build`/`verify` scoped to one phase without opening design or plan. It is
**phase-scoped, not per-cycle**, and **region-owned** (each region has one
writer):

- **gather** authors the **contract region** once, when a phase first becomes the
  active `⬜` phase. On later cycles, if a brief for that *same* phase already
  exists, gather **no-ops** — it leaves both regions untouched and opens no big
  doc.
- **build** consumes the whole brief. If the `## Verify feedback` region lists
  open gaps, it closes those first, then does as much of the remaining work as
  cleanly fits (ideally the whole phase). It never writes the brief.
- **verify** re-derives truth independently. **Pass** → flip `⬜→✅`, commit, and
  **delete** the brief. **Gap** → leave `⬜`, change no source, and **overwrite**
  the feedback region with only the currently-open gaps (each tied to an `R-id`
  and grounded in the exact failing command/output) — the brief **persists** so
  the next `build` sees the feedback. On a **true stall** (same gap ids, no new
  build commit, 3 consecutive no-progress attempts) verify does a **trajectory
  reset**: log it to `~/.ralph/verify.log`, delete the brief, leave `⬜` — the
  next `gather` rebuilds the contract fresh from spec.

## Why it converges (and terminates)

`verify` can neither halt the loop nor advance a phase on a gap, so an incomplete
phase just stays `⬜` and is re-attacked next cycle — now with grounded feedback
in front of `build`, and without `gather` re-reading the big docs (it no-ops on
the in-flight brief). The persisted feedback gives `verify` cross-cycle memory to
tell *slow convergence* (shrinking gap set) from a *true stall* (identical gaps,
no new commit) and reset the latter. The **only** exit is `gather → DONE`, which
requires **zero `⬜` markers** — so the run ends only when every phase is verified
green (or a ralph budget rail trips).

## `project/loops/brief.md` schema

Two regions, one writer each:

```
# Brief — Phase NN: <one-line objective>

phase: NN
realizes: D<n>[, D<m>]
decision_files:
  - project/design/D0n.md

## Ids to cover
R-XXXX-XXXX — <full requirement text copied verbatim from the Decision's Verification list>
R-YYYY-YYYY — <full requirement text copied verbatim>
# ...one id per line in that exact `R-... — text` form, OR:
# (none — structural phase; see the Done bar's named content check)

## Design prose (copied verbatim from the DNN.md — Verification lists omitted)
### Decision <n> — <title>
<Decision statement + shape/signatures + Rejected alternatives, verbatim,
 WITHOUT that Decision's Verification list>

## Files to touch
- <path>

## Dependency interfaces / required shapes (copied from design — do not open design files)
```go
// package <dep>  (from D0k)
<copied exported type / func / const signatures>
```

## Done bar
- Every "Ids to cover" id covered by a genuinely-asserting, reachable
  `// R-XXXX-XXXX`-tagged test (structural: the named content check instead).
- Test placement: co-located with the code exercised, named for the behavior,
  never a per-phase or root-level test file.
- The suite is green: go build ./... · go vet ./... · gofmt -l . (empty) ·
  go test ./...
- <any phase-specific content check, copied verbatim>

## Verify feedback
<!-- gather leaves empty; verify overwrites with attempt N, build commit,
     stall streak, and the current open-gap checklist -->
```

- **gather-owned contract region** — everything from the header through the Done
  bar. Written once per phase; `verify` never writes here.
- **verify-owned feedback region** — the `## Verify feedback — attempt N`
  heading with its per-attempt counter, the observed build commit, the stall
  streak, and a checklist of **only** the open gaps. `gather` writes it empty;
  `verify` overwrites it each gap cycle; `build` reads but never writes it.
