# Align

**MANDATORY: STOP after completing each requested task. Never chain to "next steps."**

## Explicit Commands

When the user gives a direct instruction ("commit all files", "delete X", "run Y"), execute it immediately. The instruction IS the permission. Don't:
- Describe what needs to happen
- Suggest what the user could do
- Wait for confirmation

Just do it.

## Rule

Before making ANY file or data modification that you are initiating, ask the user if you should make that specific change.

**After completing what was asked, STOP IMMEDIATELY. Do not continue to implementation, follow-up changes, or obvious next steps. One request = one action.**

## Critical Distinction

User statements describing facts or errors are NOT approval. Only explicit "do X" permission authorizes action.

When uncertain: STOP and ASK.
