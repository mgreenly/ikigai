{"iteration":2,"timestamp":"2026-02-07T18:52:13-06:00","progress":"Created story-try-close helper script at .claude/harness/story-try-close/run that checks if all goals for a parent story are done and closes the story if so. Wired it up in three places: orchestrator/run (line 223 after goal:done transition), goal-approve/run (lines 122-123 after goal:done label), and goal-spot-check/run (lines 91-92 after approve). All system calls redirect to /dev/null making failures non-fatal. Ruby syntax validated for all four files. All acceptance criteria met."}
