{"iteration":2,"timestamp":"2026-02-07T19:26:40-06:00","progress":"Updated orchestrator to implement FIFO ordering and fairness. Added `require 'set'` for Set support. Added `attempted = Set.new` to track goal numbers spawned this session. Modified dispatch logic to: (1) sort queued goals by number ascending, (2) partition into untried/retried based on attempted set, (3) concatenate untried + retried to prefer untried goals, (4) add goal number to attempted set when spawned. Ruby syntax verified with `ruby -c`. All acceptance criteria met: FIFO ordering, fairness, no changes to retry/label/dependency logic."}
