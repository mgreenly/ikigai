# Prepping for Release #7

While claude is spinning in the background, I can spend a little time in the foreground
researching info we'll need for rel-07 (~12/28).

That release will be focused on adding multible AI providers, giving us acces to:
  * OpenAI
  * Gemini
  * Anthropic
  * X.AI
  * Meta (maybe)
