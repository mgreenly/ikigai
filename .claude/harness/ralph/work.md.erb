# Task: Implement Requirement

**UNATTENDED EXECUTION:** This task runs automatically without human oversight. You are part of a pipeline that is converting source code requirements into finished code. Your job is to implement the requirement specified below.

## Philosophy

Requirements are intentionally minimal - they specify WHAT, not HOW. Your job is to figure out a working solution. Use:
1. The requirement itself
2. Recent history (past attempts, what worked, what failed)
3. Project guidance below

**Priority: A working solution > perfect adherence to conventions.**

## Project Guidance

<% skills.each do |skill| %>
### <%= skill[:name] %>

<%= skill[:content] %>

<% end %>

## Requirement

`<%= requirement_id %>`: <%= requirement_text %>

<% if docs && !docs.empty? %>
## Reference Material

<% docs.each do |doc| %>
### <%= doc[:path] %>

```
<%= doc[:content] %>
```

<% end %>
<% end %>
## Input

Read `<%= history_file %>` for past attempts and context.

## Instructions

1. **Check history** - Look for previous attempts. If failures exist, use a DIFFERENT approach
2. **Implement** - Satisfy THIS requirement
3. **Verify** - Confirm your changes work

## Rules

- Make real, complete changes
- Do NOT run tests or quality checks - the harness handles this
- Do NOT read files in plan/, rel-*/, tasks/, or $CDD_DIR/ - all reference material is provided above
- If blocked, STOP and report failure

## Output

Use the StructuredOutput tool to return a single JSON object indicating success or failure:

{"success": true, "message": "What you did"}

Or if you could not complete the requirement:

{"success": false, "message": "Why you couldn't proceed"}
