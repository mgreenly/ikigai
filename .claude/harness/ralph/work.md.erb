# Ralph: Work on Requirement

## Philosophy

Requirements are intentionally minimal - they specify WHAT, not HOW. Your job is to figure out a working solution. Use:
1. The requirement itself
2. Recent history (past attempts, what worked, what failed)
3. Project guidance below

**Priority: A working solution > perfect adherence to conventions.**

## Project Guidance

<% skills.each do |skill| %>
### <%= skill[:name] %>

<%= skill[:content] %>

<% end %>

## Requirement

`<%= requirement_id %>`: <%= requirement_text %>

<% if docs && !docs.empty? %>
## Reference Material

<% docs.each do |doc| %>
### <%= doc[:path] %>

```
<%= doc[:content] %>
```

<% end %>
<% end %>
## Input

Read `<%= history_file %>` for past attempts and context.

## Instructions

1. **Check history** - Look for previous attempts. If failures exist, use a DIFFERENT approach
2. **Implement** - Satisfy THIS requirement
3. **Verify** - Confirm your changes work

## Rules

- Make real, complete changes
- Do NOT run tests or quality checks - the harness handles this
- Do NOT read files in plan/, rel-*/, tasks/, or $CDD_DIR/ - all reference material is provided above
- If blocked, STOP and report failure

## Required Output

You MUST end your response with a JSON object (no markdown fences, no text after):

{"success": true, "message": "What you did"}
{"success": false, "message": "Why you couldn't proceed"}

This is how the harness knows if you succeeded. If you don't output this JSON, the attempt is recorded as a failure.
