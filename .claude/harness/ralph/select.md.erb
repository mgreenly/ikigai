# Task: Select Next Requirement

**UNATTENDED EXECUTION:** This task runs automatically without human oversight. You are part of a pipeline that is converting source code requirements into finished code. Your job is to select the next requirement for a worker agent to implement. After you select a requirement, the worker agent will implement it, the harness will commit changes and run quality checks, and fix agents will attempt repairs if checks fail. When all checks pass, the requirement is marked done and the pipeline returns to you to select the next requirement. Use the "Pending Requirements" and "Recent History" sections below to determine which requirement should be worked on next.

## Pending Requirements

<% pending.each do |req| %>
- `<%= req[:id] %>`: <%= req[:requirement] %>
<% end %>
<% if pending.empty? %>
(none)
<% end %>

## Recent History

```
<%= history.empty? ? "(none)" : history %>
```

## Output

For the final result, use the StructuredOutput tool to return a single JSON object with the selected ID as an integer:

{"id": 1}

Or if there are no remaining pending requirements, return the string "none":

{"id": "none"}
