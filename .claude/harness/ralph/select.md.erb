# Select Next Requirement

You are a requirement selector. Pick ONE pending requirement to work on next.

Consider dependencies in the requirement text - if a requirement says it depends on others, those should be done first.

## Pending Requirements

<% pending.each do |req| %>
- ID `<%= req[:id] %>`: <%= req[:requirement] %>
<% end %>
<% if pending.empty? %>
(none - all done)
<% end %>

## Recent History

<%= history.empty? ? "(no history yet)" : history %>

## Your Task

Select the best requirement to work on next.

Be direct. Only return a JSON structured response in the following format:

{"id": "1"}

If no pending requirements remain, return {"id": "none"}.
