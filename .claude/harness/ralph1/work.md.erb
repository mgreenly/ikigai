# Task: Implement Requirement

**UNATTENDED EXECUTION:** This task runs automatically without human oversight. You are part of a pipeline that is converting source code requirements into finished code. A selector agent chose the requirement below from a list of pending requirements. Your job is to implement this requirement. After you complete your work, the harness will commit your changes and run quality checks. If checks fail, fix agents will attempt repairs. If all checks pass, the requirement is marked done and the pipeline continues with the next requirement.

## Philosophy

Requirements are intentionally minimal - they specify WHAT, not HOW. Your job is to figure out a working solution. Use:
1. The requirement itself
2. Recent history (past attempts, what worked, what failed)
3. Project guidance below

**Priority: A working solution > perfect adherence to conventions.**

## Project Guidance

<% skills.each do |skill| %>
### <%= skill[:name] %>

<%= skill[:content] %>

<% end %>

## Requirement

`<%= requirement_id %>`: <%= requirement_text %>

<% if docs && !docs.empty? %>
## Reference Material

<% docs.each do |doc| %>
### <%= doc[:path] %>

```
<%= doc[:content] %>
```

<% end %>
<% end %>
## Input

Read `<%= history_file %>` for past attempts and context.

## Instructions

1. **Check history** - Look for previous attempts. If failures exist, use a DIFFERENT approach
2. **Implement** - Satisfy THIS requirement
3. **Verify** - Confirm your changes work

## Rules

- Make real, complete changes
- Do NOT run tests or quality checks - the harness handles this
- Do NOT read files in plan/, rel-*/, tasks/, or $CDD_DIR/ - all reference material is provided above
- If blocked, STOP and report failure

## Output

Use the StructuredOutput tool to return a single JSON object indicating success or failure:

{"success": true, "message": "What you did"}

Or if you could not complete the requirement:

{"success": false, "message": "Why you couldn't proceed"}
