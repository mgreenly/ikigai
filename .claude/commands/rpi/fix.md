description: Fix the most critical gap identified in our release plan.
---

Apply your suggested change to the most critical identified gap.  Use the Task tool to run a sub-agent using `run_in_background=false`.  When it's complete report back it's status.  Then suggest the next fix.  Then update $PWD/scratch/verified.md to reflect the change.  $PWD/scratch/verified.md contains a list of gaps that have been fixed, so that we know not to spend effort investigating them in the future. Then use git to commit the all modified files. Then suggest the next thing to fix.
