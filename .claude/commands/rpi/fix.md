description: Fix the most critical gap identified in our release plan.
---

Apply your suggested change to the most critical identified gap.  Use the Task tool to run a sub-agent using `run_in_background=false`.  Wait for it to complete. Then update $PWD/scratch/verified.md to reflect the change. Then report the sub-agents result status then use git to commit the all modified files. Then suggest the next thing to fix.

FYI, $PWD/scratch/verified.md contains a list of gaps that have been previously fixed, so that we know not to spend effort investigating them in the future.
