description: Find the most critical gap our release plan.
---

We're doing our final preparation and reviewing $PWD/scratch/tasks/ prior to implementing them. We're keeping track of the things we've already verified in $PWD/scratch/verified.md so that we don't re-check things we've already verified. Use sub-agents to review $PWD/scratch/tasks/ and find the issues most likely to prevent successful completion of this release. Suggest a fix for the most critical gap identified.
