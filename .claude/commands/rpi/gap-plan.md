description: Find the most critical alignment gap in release plan.
---

Check top-down alignment: `release/README.md` (goals) -> `release/user-stories/` (user perspective) -> `release/plan/` (implementation). Verify plan implements what README promises and user-stories demonstrate. Check `release/verified.md` to avoid re-checking resolved items. Report the most critical alignment gap and suggest a fix.
