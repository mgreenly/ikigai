description: Find the most critical gap in release tasks.
---

**Requires:** `$CDD_DIR` environment variable must be set to the workspace directory.

Review `$CDD_DIR/tasks/` for gaps that would prevent successful execution. Check `$CDD_DIR/verified.md` to avoid re-checking resolved items. Use sub-agents for thorough analysis. Report the most critical gap and suggest a fix.
