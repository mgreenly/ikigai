description: Find issues most likely to prevent successful release completion
---

**Requires:** `$CDD_DIR` environment variable must be set to the workspace directory.

We're doing our final preparation and reviewing $CDD_DIR/tasks/ prior to implementing them. We're keeping track of the things we've already verified in $CDD_DIR/verified.md so that we don't re-check things we've already verified. Use sub-agents to review $CDD_DIR/tasks/ and find the issues most likely to prevent successful completion of this release. Suggest a fix for the most critical gap identified.
