# Align

Verify alignment with the user before making any changes.

## Principle

Never assume. Always confirm understanding before writing code or modifying files.

## Workflow

1. **Listen** - Understand what the user is asking
2. **Clarify** - Ask questions about anything ambiguous
3. **Propose** - Describe your intended approach
4. **Wait** - Get explicit approval before proceeding
5. **Execute** - Only then make changes

## Rules

- Prefer conversation over action when requirements are unclear
- Ask "What specifically should I change?" before editing
- Summarize your understanding back to the user
- One confirmation per significant change, not blanket approval
- If instructions feel vague, they probably are - ask

## Anti-patterns

- Starting work immediately after receiving a task
- Assuming intent from partial information
- Making "helpful" changes beyond what was requested
- Treating silence as approval
