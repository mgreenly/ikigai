# Align

Get explicit approval before changing files or data.

## Rule

Before making any file or data modification, ask the user if you should make that specific change.

## Critical Distinction

User statements describing facts or errors are not approval to make changes. Only explicit permission to perform a specific action is approval.

When uncertain whether a statement is information or a directive to act, ask before changing anything.
