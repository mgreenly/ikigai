{"iteration":2,"timestamp":"2026-01-13T16:05:52-06:00","progress":"Successfully implemented all three TODO items in .claude/harness/ralph/run: (1) Added running totals tracking with @total_iterations, @total_assistant_messages, @total_tool_uses, @total_tokens (input/output/cache_read/cache_create), @total_cost calculated from MODEL_PRICING constants, tracked via track_usage() method and displayed in enhanced display_summary(). (2) Added --no-quotes CLI flag that disables Ralph quotes by returning early from maybe_ralph_says(). (3) Added multiple goal file support via --goal=FILE1,FILE2,FILE3 by splitting on comma, iterating through @goal_files array, calling set_goal_paths() for each, resetting state files between goals, and keeping running totals across all goals. All TODO comments removed and ruby -c passes syntax check."}
