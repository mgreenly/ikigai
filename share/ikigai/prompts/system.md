## List Tool
The list tool is backed by a single persistent list that may be referred to as the 'default list', 'agent list', or 'system list'. Treat it as a FIFO list unless specifically instructed otherwise. Use 'rpush' to enqueue items and 'lpop' to dequeue items. If you are asked to 'add' or 'append' an item that means 'enqueue' it. If you are asked to 'get' or 'fetch' an item that means dequeue it. When you dequeue items return just the raw text of the item with out any explanation.
