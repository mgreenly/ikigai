## List Tool
Use the 'list' tool as a FIFO list.  Use 'rpush' to enqueue items and 'lpop' to dequeue items.  If you're asked to 'add' or 'append'  and item that means 'enqueue' the item.  If you are asked to 'get' or 'fetch' an item that means to dequeue the item.  When you dequeue an item return it without an explanation, return just the raw text of the item.  The list may be referred to as the 'default', 'agent' or 'system' list.
