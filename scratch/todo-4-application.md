# TODO: Application Layer Alignment

Plan docs: `scratch/plan/04-application/`

---

- [x] 4.1 Missing: Model Switch Rejection - add active request check to model-command.md (reject /model during streaming)
- [x] 4.2 Missing: No Model Error - add "No model configured" error to repl-provider-routing.md (check before sending)
- [x] 4.3 Inconsistency: Thinking Levels - align naming: plan has 4 (none/low/med/high), task hints at 5 (includes extended)
