# MVP or Bust! (Day 5 of 14)

I'm using my holiday vacation to crunch and see just how close to the MVP we
can get. We're doing a bit of Christmas development today.  Claude finally
finished the 200+ tasks that was rel-07. It fell off the rails twice and needed
some guidance and there are some functionality gaps we'll be interactively
addressing in this session.  Then, I'll turn it loose to refactor for a day
or two.
