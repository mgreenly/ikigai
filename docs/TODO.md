separate credentials from config

can't change the system message because the config overwrites it when it loads

add a /tool command that shows the tool's available

A /chain command that let's you start a series of prompts, each starting on fresh context after the successful completion of the previous step.

A /loop command that let's you start the same prompt if it is still running when it stops becuase of context exhastion.

Context should de-deuplicate
