{"iteration":2,"timestamp":"2026-01-16T20:13:37-06:00","progress":"Created src/tools/web_search_google/main.c with working Google Custom Search API integration. Implemented --schema flag returning exact JSON schema per spec, stdin reading with JSON parsing, credential discovery from GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY/GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID env vars and ~/.config/ikigai/credentials.json, AUTH_MISSING error with complete _event field including kind:config_required and setup instructions, HTTP GET requests to Google API using libcurl with query/num/start parameters, response parsing with yyjson mapping Google items[] to results[], rate limit error detection for dailyLimitExceeded reason, and network error handling. Updated Makefile with web_search_google_tool target linking against -lcurl, added to tools aggregate. Tool compiles successfully, --schema outputs valid JSON, missing credentials returns exit 0 with proper error JSON including _event field, empty input and invalid JSON return exit 1 as expected. Remaining work: implement domain filtering (allowed_domains/blocked_domains) with parallel API calls for multiple allowed domains, URL deduplication, round-robin merge, and partial failure handling per tool-schemas.md:575-634."}
{"iteration":3,"timestamp":"2026-01-16T20:18:21-06:00","progress":"Implemented complete domain filtering logic with parallel API calls for web_search_google tool. Added support for multiple allowed_domains using CURLM multi interface with parallel API calls, splitting num parameter across domains using integer division (per_domain + remainder for first domains), round-robin merge with URL deduplication via url_already_seen helper, and partial failure handling returning results from successful calls. Implemented single allowed_domain using native siteSearch=domain&siteSearchFilter=i, single blocked_domain using siteSearchFilter=e, and multiple blocked_domains using post-processing. Updated Makefile install and uninstall targets to include web-search-google-tool. Tool compiles cleanly, --schema outputs valid JSON matching spec, missing credentials returns exit 0 with AUTH_MISSING error and complete _event field. Committed changes with detailed commit message. Core implementation complete per plan specifications - remaining work is comprehensive unit test coverage."}
