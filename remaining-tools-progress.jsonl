{"iteration":2,"timestamp":"2026-01-14T17:57:06-06:00","progress":"Implemented all 5 missing external tools (file_read, file_write, file_edit, glob, grep) following the bash_tool architectural pattern. Created source files in src/tools/{file_read,file_write,file_edit,glob,grep}/main.c, each implementing JSON I/O protocol with --schema support, talloc memory management, and comprehensive error handling. Added Makefile targets for individual builds (file_read_tool, etc.) and collective \"tools\" target. All binaries build successfully to libexec/ikigai/ with hyphenated names (file-read, file-write, etc.) while schemas use underscore format (file_read, file_write, etc.) per specification. Verified functionality: file_read handles offset/limit correctly, file_write reports bytes written, file_edit validates arguments and handles replace_all, glob finds files with correct counts, grep searches with POSIX regex. All error cases tested (FILE_NOT_FOUND, PERMISSION_DENIED, NOT_UNIQUE, INVALID_ARG). Clean rebuild successful. All acceptance criteria met: prerequisites verified, build integration complete, schemas compliant, functional correctness confirmed, memory safety ensured via talloc cleanup paths."}
